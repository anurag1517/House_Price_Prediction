### Inspiration 

My father went on to buy a plot and was confused about its price and I had set my foot in Machine Learning just then so got the idea of my first project.

---

### What it does

It gives predicted price based on the given attributes.

### Attributes info


    1. CRIM      per capita crime rate by town
    2. ZN        proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 
                 25,000 sq.ft.
    3. INDUS     proportion of non-retail business acres per town
    4. CHAS      Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds 
                 river; 0 otherwise)
    5. NOX       nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
    6. RM        average number of rooms per dwelling
    7. AGE       proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
    8. DIS       weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
    9. RAD       index of accessibility to radial highways
    10. TAX      full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
    11. PTRATIO  pupil-teacher ratio by town
    12. B        1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks 
                 by town
    13. LSTAT    % lower status of the population
    14. MEDV     Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's.

### How is it built

based on the train dataset it is trained and tested o the test data set.
It is made in google colabs with the help of libraries like pandas,numpy,sklearn,matplotlib.

### Challenges faced

This being my first project in the supervised machine learning.So, I had very less number of choices when it came to model selection as i had very least idea about the functionality of decision tree and random forest and other such models .

The challenges like coming up with better rmse score is still on and will be tackled.

### Accomplishment 

I was able to make a regression model with a descent rmse and was a sense of curiousity to make it better and a amazed look at my father's face.

#### Future Improvements

-Looking for other models with better rmse score.
-making a UI for easy interaction with model.
